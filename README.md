### Notes
- **Screenshots**: The README references screenshot placeholders (`images/javascript-example.png`, etc.). You‚Äôll need to generate actual screenshots by applying the theme in VS Code and capturing the editor with sample code (e.g., the JavaScript test file from the previous response). If you need help generating these, let me know!
- **GitHub Repository**: The README assumes a GitHub repo at `https://github.com/yashyc7/ultrafocus-theme`. Update this URL to your actual repository or remove it if you‚Äôre not hosting the theme publicly.
- **Marketplace**: The ‚ÄúFrom VS Code Marketplace‚Äù section is included as a placeholder. If you plan to publish the theme, you‚Äôll need to package and submit it to the VS Code Marketplace. Otherwise, you can remove this section.
